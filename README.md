# later-data-practicum
### Fall 2024

This repository is for DATA Pacticum semester client project with Later, a social media and influencer marketing company. 
In this project, we wants to explore about if images be classified into useful categories at scale and at low cost, and with one million images with no words or labels, we'd like to conduct research on available open-source models and look for solutions to categorize images, as well as add labels and keywords to each piece of media.
